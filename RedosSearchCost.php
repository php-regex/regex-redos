/**
 * The cost of an unanchored search whose every attempt is linear: an
 * attempt started inside a run of the run word reads to the end of the run,
 * then fails on the breaker, and the search starts one at each position of
 * the run. On the prefix, the run repeated n times, then the breaker,
 * PCRE2's interpreter takes a number of steps quadratic in n; so do the
 * retries of preg_match_all(), preg_replace() and preg_split(). The JIT may
 * avoid it for some patterns. pcre.backtrack_limit does not stop it: the
 * limit is counted per attempt, and trips only when one attempt exceeds it.
 *
 * The prefix, often empty, keeps the first attempt from matching the bare
 * run: "^\s+" in "/^\s+|\s+$/" would.
 *
 * The parts hold raw bytes; toArray() gives them as PHP double-quoted
 * literals, like RedosWitness.
